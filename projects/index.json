        "description": "itZ the end of JAZZ as we know it (jazzs not dead) - by dr boo / kai boo\n@fuuturejazz.the_original @dr_booooo @freejazzwannabe\nto be honest this piece is like a stairway into my brain, this is often what it sounds like up there so welcome!!\nMy crew fuuturejazz is morphing into something new so it feels like the jazz is dying but also just waiting on the resurrection. In terms of choosing samples (it was tricky!!! so many samples were left behind…) I tried to fit in as much as possible, i like the abrupt switches from soft/smooth/blends/layers to abrupt/choppy/messy/quick switch ups. I had a lot of fun making this!!! I made sure some samples are clear even on first listen but I also love music like dj shadow/shitmat/klf where with each new listen as you get to know the piece more and more samples come out of hiding, so i tried to also “obscure” some samples from (ear)view i’d like to practice this more\nAs always inspired by free jazz, shitmat, neuroqueer brain, break/mash/flashcore, sun ra, dj shadow, The KLF."

        "description": "I combed through videos and audio throughout my camera roll/albums, finding which sounds felt evocative of a certain moment in time—the resounding thought I had became: what sounds have I made, what sounds have I heard. My intention is to bring the listener into a gallery/collection of memories using both a visual and auditory approach, prioritizing the emotional weight of a memory over the literal experience. Weaving together these overlapping sounds and images, manipulating them into something semi-cohesive I felt like sampling served as an absorbing way to view memory and nostalgia—fractured, incoherent, refracted, manipulated.\nSo much of what’s compelling about sampling is listening for a refrain you recognize. These are my own videos, sounds, and experiences but many of these sounds are recognizably nostalgic—the tinkling bell of an ice cream vendor, an automated train voice, friends singing you happy birthday, or a count down to new years."

        "description": "This piece is called 'Baggs', inspired by Mel Baggs' video 'In My Language',  detailing their view of the world through sound, not as it relates to any familiar social constructs that we've attributed to certain auditory textures, but as those textures relate to themselves. In this way, Baggs is a conceptual artist using sound as their readymades. I wanted to continue in their tradition, using their voice to make a piece that exists for the sake of itself. I sampled an interview with Genesis P. Orridge, a philosophy talk show from the 80s called Thinking Aloud, 'In My Language', and Nick Flynn's poem 'My Mother Contemplating Her Gun'. When I made this, I was listening to a lot of Bassvictim. I was also thinking about how songs like 'Brandon Ingram' by Rroxket are so rhythmic without being overtly inclusionary of drums."

        "description": "Welcome to 'möbius soup.' As you begin listening, you'll shortly find yourself stuck in an 8-bar loop. Impatient, the drums will start to speed up in an attempt to flee. As the song reaches 200 BPM, you crash into an experimental soup of noise. You've escaped! Except... if you listen close enough, the very end is simply the reverse of the beginning: the entire song is a möbius loop. All samples have been stemmed with Fadr. The drums are sampled from a 1996 DnB track by British artist Kid Loops. Other samples are from 90s Japanese abstract jazz/experimental electronic music artists DJ Hati-Monji, Masaaki Kitta, and Computer Soup. 'Soup's secrets will always be elusive, as slippery as Computer Soup's asymmetric synthesis of sibilations.' -Gil Gershman in 'Out Of Perspective' released by Soup-Disk."

        "description": "In the midst of the chaos of the city, I always try to find the stillness contained within. The alleyways, the quiet bookstore, or a walk through the park are juxtaposed with the honks of traffic, street performers, or voices of people. A recent journey to Chicago inspired me to sample the sounds I heard and create something that could reflect the transition between the two opposites; tranquility and disruption, calm and chaotic, peace and distress. All sounds in this track were recorded using my audio recorder and camera, and subsequently sampled in a DAW. I've always loved synths and their versatility, and I was fortunate to capture a sound that I could morph into one to make chords. And shoutout to The Chicago Bucket Boys for the drum samples."

This piece is meant to represent the dichotomy of destruction and creation, as well as the struggle for attention in the internet age. Samples were chopped at random and performed on a MIDI keyboard. What begins as sparse and hesitant culimates into a cacophonic climax."

        "description": "OFF LINE//ON WATER begins with the sound of a gentle rainfall, but soon evolves into a rich collection of vocal and instrumental samples, which build off of one another to create a haunting (yet groovy!) refrain. The piece is not meant to be a reflection upon anything in particular, but is more akin to an experiment; both recognizable and ambiguous sounds are layered, culminating in one disorienting soundscape that, by the end, renders each sample’s singularity destroyed."
